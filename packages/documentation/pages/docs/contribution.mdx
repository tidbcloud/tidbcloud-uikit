# How to contribute

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js v20](https://nodejs.org/)
- [pnpm v8](https://pnpm.io/) to manage packages and dependencies
- [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for rapid UI component development and testing
- [changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets) for changes documentation, changelog generation, and release management.

## Scripts

### Root directory

- `pnpm install`: bootstraps the entire project, symlinks all dependencies for cross-component development and builds all components.
- `pnpm build`: run build for all component packages.
- `pnpm release`: publish changed packages.
- `pnpm storybook`: starts storybook server and loads stories in files that end with .stories.tsx.
- `pnpm gen:embedded-story`: generate embedded story for documentation.

### `packages/uikit`

- `pnpm build:icon`: generate react components from all svg files in `packages/uikit/src/icons/raw` and save to `packages/uikit/src/icons/react`.

### `packages/documentation`

- `pnpm dev`: start the local dev server for documentation.
- `pnpm build`: run lint and build the documentation.

## Developing

Run `pnpm i && pnpm build && pnpm storybook` to start the project in development mode.

Your working area is uikit and stories. Once you finish your coding in the uikit, please write some stories for testing.

### Icons

To add new icons, you can put the svg file to `packages/uikit/src/icons/raw` folder then run `pnpm build:icon` under `packages/uikit` directory to generate the react component.

It will also update the import entry in `packages/uikit/src/icons/index.ts`. Note that you should always use the script to update it and avoid manually modifing the import entry file.

The icon script will

- scan all the svg icon in `packages/uikit/src/icons/raw` folder
- Rename all the svg file to PasCal case (or upper camel case)
- Use svgr to generate correspondent react jsx code to `packages/uikit/src/icons/react` folder
- Use a custom code template to support other props such as `size`
- By default, it will skip if there are already a jsx file with same name, unless you pass a `--force` flag

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  Note that the svg file should be aligned with our design standard. It should be 24x24 by default and no hard-coded
  color or stroke in all attributes otherwise we wouldn't be able to customize it via css.
</Callout>

### Developing documentation

After installing dependencies with `pnpm install`, cd to `packages/documentation`, create a .env file with following content:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_STORYBOOK_HOST=https://tidbcloud-uikit-story.netlify.app/

# if you want to reference your local storybook, set to
# NEXT_PUBLIC_STORYBOOK_HOST=http://localhost:6006
```

then run `pnpm dev` to start the local dev server for documentation.

### Making a pull request

#### Commit Convention

Before you create a Pull Request, please check whether your commits comply with the commit conventions used in this repository.
When you create a commit, you should follow the convention category(scope or module): message in your commit message while using one of the following categories:

- feat/feature: all changes that introduce completely new code or new features
  - For example: feat(uikit/components), feat(uikit/hooks)
- fix: changes that fix a bug (ideally you will additionally reference an issue if present)
- refactor: any code related change that is not a fix nor a feature
- chore: all changes to the repository that do not fit into any of the above categories

### Pull Request

Once you've committed your message. You can do your PR

1. Make a changeset

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

2. Follow the changeset interactive prompts, commit your change

```bash
git commit -m 'feat(uikit): your message'
```

3. Push the changes, request a PR. Waiting for the review and merged with the master

### Release Process

Each pull request that includes user-facing changes or API modifications should include a changeset:

1. Generate a changeset file:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

2. Follow the interactive prompts to:

   - Select the packages that have changed
   - Choose the type of change (major/minor/patch)

3. The changeset summary will be generated automatically from commit history. Commit the generated `.changeset/*.md` file along with your changes.

The changeset bot will also check your PR and comment if a changeset is missing in your PR. You can also use the link provided by the bot to create a changeset directly through GitHub's UI.

Then the release process will be handled automatically:

- When PRs with changesets are merged, a Release PR that will bump the version and update the changelog will be created by the changeset bot.
- Once the Release PR is approved and merged, packages will be published to the registry automatically.

### Prerelease

For beta versions, you can use the following command to enter prerelease mode, then follow the instructions just like the normal release process to include a changeset in every PR:

```bash
npx changeset pre enter beta
```

After you are done with your beta changes, you can exit the prerelease mode by running:

```bash
npx changeset pre exit
```

Then run `changeset version` to version packages with normal versions.

### Snapshot release

Snapshot releases are a way to release your changes for testing without impacting real users. They allow you to publish experimental versions based on your current branch.

#### Triggering via GitHub Actions (Recommended)

The easiest way to create a snapshot release is through GitHub Actions:

1.  Go to the **Actions** tab in the `tidbcloud/uikit` repository.
2.  Find and select the **Manual Snapshot Release** workflow in the left sidebar.
3.  Click the **Run workflow** dropdown button on the right.
4.  Select the branch you want to release from (usually your feature branch).
5.  Click the green **Run workflow** button.

The CI/CD pipeline will then automatically:

- Build the necessary packages.
- Version the packages using a timestamp format (e.g., `0.0.0-20250423031914`).
- Publish these packages to npm under the `experimental` tag.

Once the workflow completes, you can install the snapshot version in other projects using `pnpm add @tidbcloud/uikit@experimental` or `yarn add @tidbcloud/uikit@experimental`.

#### Manual Triggering (Alternative)

Alternatively, you can still create a snapshot release manually. First, create a changeset just like the normal release process:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Then, use the snapshot flag to bump the versions:

```bash
npx changeset version --snapshot
```

This will apply the changeset, but instead of using the next semantic version, all versions will be set to `0.0.0-<TIMESTAMP>`.

After running the version command, you will need to use the publish command locally to release the packages:

```bash
npx changeset publish --tag experimental
```

Using the `--tag experimental` flag ensures you do not publish it to the `latest` tag on npm. This is **crucial** because omitting the tag would cause users installing with `pnpm add @tidbcloud/uikit` (or yarn) to get the snapshot version instead of the latest stable release.
