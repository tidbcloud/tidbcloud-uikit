## Installation

Inside your React project directory, run the following command to install the package:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @tidbcloud/uikit
```

## Quick Start

Wrap your application root component with `MantineProvider`:

```js
import { MantineProvider } from '@tidbcloud/uikit';

function Main() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider withGlobalStyles withNormalizeCSS>
      <App />
    </MantineProvider>
  );
}
```

You can now import and use any components anywhere in your application:

```js
import { Button } from '@tidbcloud/uikit';

function Demo() {
  return <Button>Click me!</Button>;
}
```
